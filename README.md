1. Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object. Players are also going to be stored in object. Also need an object to control the flow of the game itself.
  - Have as little global code as possible. Use modules or a factory.
  - I created a module for the gameBoard and for the displayController. Used a Factory for the players since there will be more than 1.

2. Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s).
  - I created the display function within the gameBoard module which will loops over the gameBoardArray and displays its contents.
  - I also added a bit of stylying to make it look more like a tic-tac-toe game :)

3. Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Donâ€™t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken! 
  - I added a click event listener to teh gameboard. Whenever a user clicks on the gameboard, the game will use the current player (player X or O) as well as the gamepiece that was clicked to determine if the X or O can be placed. If the selection is successful (there was no piece already there), then it switches to the next player's turn;

4. Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
  - Not sure if this was the most efficient way (probs not), but I used a regex to determine if my array (when joined as a string) matched the winning combinations. If so, I called the gameOver function which essentially alerts who won (or a tie), and sets the gameFinished property to true so that additional boxes can no longer be clicked.

5. Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
  - I decided not to add names and to just keep it as PLayer X and player O.
  - I did include a new game button, which will start a new game, but keep the current scores.
  - I added a restart button, which will restart the entire game and clear the current scores.
  - There is an game-status element which will state the current player's turn and also congratulate the winning player (or a tie).
