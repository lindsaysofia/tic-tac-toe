1. Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object. Players are also going to be stored in object. Also need an object to control the flow of the game itself.
  - Have as little global code as possible. Use modules or a factory.
  - I created a module for the gameBoard and for the displayController. Used a Factory for the players since there will be more than 1.

2. Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s).
  - I created the display function within the gameBoard module which will loops over the gameBoardArray and displays its contents.
  - I also added a bit of stylying to make it look more like a tic-tac-toe game :)

3. Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Donâ€™t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
